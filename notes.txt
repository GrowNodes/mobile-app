Props passed via Actions.route({props}) are static. Therefore:
Pass selected object IDs to next route and use connect to fetch them from state
Ex. selectedGrownodeId, selectedGrownodeTodoId
There is no way this will turn into unmaintainable spaghetti. /s

static onRight() in component overwrites onRight() prop in <Scene/>
Can also do this with renderRightText or something names similar
